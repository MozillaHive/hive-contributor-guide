## Making the Most of Hive NYC

* **Talk to people**
 * Whether you have an opinion on something another member is involved in or have some experiences that could be of interest to others—keep in touch, develop partnerships and contribute to the dialogue.
* **Work with other members**
 * The most effective way to maximize on Hive NYC is by collaborating with other members in the creation of a learning experience—watch the invention happen.
* **Document your work**
 * By sharing knowledge and understanding you’ve gained, the benefits can be felt across the network, inspiring and informing others.
* **Look for ways to improve your programs**
 * As a Hive NYC community member, you will have access to innovative new tools and techniques in learning—a continuous source of opportunities to develop your own projects.

### What does a successful member of Hive NYC look like?
As with any community, our learning network is strongest when a diversity of stakeholders participates. Success comes in many forms, but members who flourish within Hive NYC typically:
* are in regular contact with Hive / other members
* see connecting with members in different fields as an opportunity
* welcome differing perspectives on learning from their own
* wre on the look-out for ways to exploit digital media and technology to unlock real opportunities for young people
* leverage the expertise, resources and tools within the community to make their programs more connected
* advocate for positive change throughout the NYC learning landscape
* make themselves available/discoverable to other members
* suggest and pilot ambitious programs.

Contribution to Hive is strongest (and most beneficial for everyone) when there is an alignment between your organizational/individual priorities, local context, funding prerogatives and the network's shared vision.
