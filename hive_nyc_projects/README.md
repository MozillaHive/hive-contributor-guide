### What does a successful member of Hive NYC look like?
As with any community, our learning network is strongest when a diversity of stakeholders participates. Success comes in many forms, but members who flourish within Hive NYC typically:
* are in regular contact with Hive / other members
* see connecting with members in different fields as an opportunity
* welcome differing perspectives on learning from their own
* wre on the look-out for ways to exploit digital media and technology to unlock real opportunities for young people
* leverage the expertise, resources and tools within the community to make their programs more connected
* advocate for positive change throughout the NYC learning landscape
* make themselves available/discoverable to other members
* suggest and pilot ambitious programs.

Contribution to Hive is strongest (and most beneficial for everyone) when there is an alignment between your organizational/individual priorities, local context, funding prerogatives and the network's shared vision.
