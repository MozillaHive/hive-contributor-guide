# Hive NYC Projects

A snapshot of a few past projects to give you a flavor of what Hive NYC does:
* **[Race to the White House](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/race-to-the-white-house/)**
 * Global Kids and Brooklyn Public Library partnered on a program in which youth used GPS technology to engage on policy issues. Geocaches placed in physical locations created a digital scavenger hunt, with participants expressing a vote on the importance of each issue by moving the items closer to or further from the White House.
* **[Explainers as Designers](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/explainers-as-designers/)**
 * Iridescent Learning and NY Hall of Science collaborated on a program in which young people helped to enhance the educational visitor experience. Teams designed, coded, produced and pitched a mobile app to increase visitor engagement.
* **[Y-MVP](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/y-mvp/)**
 * YMCA of Greater New York, the Institute of Play and Global Kids teamed up on the Y-MVP program to incorporate digital badging with health and fitness. Teens used custom hardware and software to plan workouts and earn points, unlocking achievements and awards.
* **[KickFlip](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/kickflip/)**
 * In the KickFlip project funded by Hive Digital Media Learning Fund and the New York Community Trust, City Lore invited teen skateboarders to share their perspectives by making films. Participants learned filmmaking skills, analyzing their interests and social roles. In a second phase, young people learned to design and code games exploring the experience of skateboarding.
* **[Technovation Challenge](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/technovation-challenge/)**
 * The largest and longest running global technology competition for grade 8-12 girls, the Technovation Challenge gives participants the opportunity to work with professional women in technology. The NYC Technovation Challenge was led by Iridescent Learning, partnering with YMCA, The POINT CDC, Reel Works and the Girl Scouts.
* **[Collect, Construct, Change](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/collect-construct-and-change-c3/)**
 * New York Hall of Science led the Collect, Construct, Change project in partnership with Bank Street College of Education, City Lore and Habitat Map. Participants developed an early iteration mobile tool to collect local environmental data such as carbon monoxide levels, humidity and noise pollution.

Hive NYC acts as a partner to member organizations, rather than a funderâ€”however, Hive membership affords you access to a guided funding process for your connected learning projects.
