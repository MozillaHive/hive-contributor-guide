# A Network for Learning

![Teacher Learner](../images/teacherlearner.jpeg)

***The first of Mozilla's growing community of city-wide networks, Hive NYC operates across institutions and settingsâ€”beyond the bounds of traditional classroom environments.***

In the digital age, the fundamental mode of operation and delivery is the network. By recognizing this, organizations and individuals can work together to foster dynamic, rewarding situations beyond what each could do alone.

## Every participant within Hive NYC is an educator and a learner

**Invention often happens at the intersection of diverse people and ideas.** From code clubs to science museums, over two hundred educators, designers, makers, artists, technologists, librarians and teachers from across New York City participate, representing organizations with a wide variety of missions, youth populations, institutional sizes, disciplines, strategies and areas of expertise.

Hive NYC is a living laboratory, a community building and testing together, strengthening programs and practices, and spreading what we discover. The **social ties** and **trusted relationships** between members sustain the network as a supportive, creative ecosystem.

### Hive NYC is a network for learning and _a network that learns_
