# Why a Learning Network?

In the digital age, the fundamental mode of operation and delivery is the network. By recognizing this, organizations and individuals can coordinate to work together, fostering dynamic, rewarding situations beyond what each could do alone.

In the networked context, learning is **connected**, **meaningful**, **easily accessed** and **in alignment with local interests**. Mentors and educators support youth in curating a diversity of skills to navigate *work and civic life*â€”this means moving beyond the bounds of traditional classroom environments.

Participants learned filmmaking skills, analyzing their interests and social roles, later learning to design and code games exploring the experience of skateboarding.

Invention often happens at the intersection of diverse people and ideas. Hive NYC programs frequently generate solutions that address common challenges.

Teams designed, coded, produced and pitched a mobile app to increase visitor engagement.

Participating members have a wide range of missions, youth populations, institutional sizes, disciplines, strategies and areas of expertise/focus. However, **we share a clear set of values and aspirations**.

Teens used custom hardware and software to plan workouts and earn points, unlocking achievements and awards.

Community members engage with the principles of connected learning in both program design and professional practice. Contributors use **openly-networked collaboration** that includes *peer observation*, *resource sharing* and *process documentation*.

Hive NYC is a **network for learning** and a **network that learns**:
* Creating new pathways for youth to learn valued skills.
* Sharing resources and best practices, advancing professional development.
