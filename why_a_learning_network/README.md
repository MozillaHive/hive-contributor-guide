# Networked Learning

***The first of Mozilla's growing community of city-wide networks, Hive NYC operates across insitutions and settings.***

In the digital age, the fundamental mode of operation and delivery is the network. By recognizing this, organizations and individuals can work together to foster dynamic, rewarding situations beyond what each could do alone.

**Invention often happens at the intersection of diverse people and ideas.** From code clubs to science museums, a wide range of contributors from across New York City participate, with a variety of missions, youth populations, institutional sizes, disciplines, strategies and areas of expertise.

In both program development and professional practice, community members engage with the principles of **[connected learning](http://clalliance.org/)** and **[web literacy](https://webmaker.org/en-US/resources)**.

Hive NYC programs build educators' ability to create digitally rich programs for youth.
