# Why a Learning Network?

A **network for learning**: *Hive programs provide youth with opportunities to learn valued skills through productive experiences that are stimulated by their interests.*

A **network that learns**: *Hive participants share resources and best practices, advancing their own professional development through collaborations.*

In the digital age, the fundamental mode of operation and delivery is the network. By recognizing this, organizations and individuals can coordinate to work together, fostering dynamic, rewarding situations beyond what each could do alone. With a set of shared goals in mind, this work can generate solutions that address common challenges.

In the networked context, learning is connected, meaningful, easily accessed and in alignment with local interests. Mentors and educators support youth in curating a diversity of skills to navigate work and civic lifeâ€”this means moving beyond the bounds of traditional classroom environments.

Invention often happens at the intersection of diverse people and ideas. Participating Hive NYC members have a wide range of missions, youth populations, institutional sizes, disciplines, strategies and areas of expertise/ focal points. However, we **share a clear set of values and aspirations**.

At Hive NYC, community members learn together through making, network with each other, consult, advise, discuss best practices and pedagogies, try out new technologies, engage in funded partnerships, design charettes and events, participate in affinity groups and cooperate to solve problems. Most importantly, we ***collaborate to design and implement transformative learning opportunities for and with NYC youth***.
