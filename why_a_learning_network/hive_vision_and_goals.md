# Hive Vision and Goals

Over the next five years, Hive's goals are to:
* **Mobilize** more educators to adopt [connected learning](http://clalliance.org/) practices and teach [web literacy](https://webmaker.org/en-US/resources) within a growing constellation of Hive Learning Networks.
* **Create** high-quality connected learning and web literacy tools, content, curriculum and practices for broad use.
* **Catalyze** schools, youth programs, and city agencies to provide rich connected learning and web literacy programs, especially in under-served communities.
* **Grow** demand for Hive Learning Events, Communities and Networks in new locations and sectors.

When educators and organizations make connected learning central to their practices, and more youth have opportunities to gain new digital skills, Hive will have realized its ambitious vision of educational transformation.

## Making the Web

As part of its mission to promote openness, opportunity and innovation, Mozilla shepherds Hive Learning Networks as a global community of educators and mentors empowering each other to learn, teach and make the web. Hive NYC acts as a local delivery mechanism for this ambitious movement, making and testing tools and practices in collaboration with stakeholders throughout the city.

As the flagship program in the Hive learning networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities of practice around connected learning and web literacy in cities around the world.

Members have access to a range of services and supports, including various communication channels, Mozilla's educational technology products and expertise, technical and social platforms that advance collective learning and innovation, supported routes to funding options, brokered connections to fellow organizations, dedicated consultation and more.
