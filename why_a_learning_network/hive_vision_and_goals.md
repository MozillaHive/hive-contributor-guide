# Core Values and Principles

Hive NYC is a living laboratory, a community building and testing together, strengthening programs and practices, and spreading what we discover.

Hive NYC programs are:
* **Innovative**
* **Meaningful**
* **Participatory**
* **Open**

In both program development and professional practice, community members engage with the principles of **[connected learning](http://clalliance.org/)** and **[web literacy](https://webmaker.org/en-US/resources)**:
* learning through hands-on, inquiry-based making
* using digital tools and the web
* working together with peers on shared purpose, based on strengths and expertise
* stimulating learners on their interests
* self-directed learning, helping youth to gain the skills to explore work, education and civic participation
* equality of access for ordinarily under-served youth
