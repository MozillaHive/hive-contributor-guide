# How Hive NYC Works

Hive NYC is a **network for learning** and a **network that learns**:
* Contributors work together to make and learn, using an open source approach that generates opportunities to innovate and discover.

The first of Mozilla’s growing community of city-wide networks, Hive NYC collaborators are aiming to revolutionize learning in New York city and beyond. Members learn with and from one another, share ideas and build solutions, developing the tools and practices to advance ***connected learning*** and ***web literacy***.

## Getting Involved

You are invited to join our collective effort to:
* **develop**, **share** and **scale**
* new **ideas**, **tools** and **approaches to learning**
* **connecting young people to opportunity** through interest-driven production and social interaction.

Hive NYC programs create a distributed learning laboratory where innovations are both developed and spread. Activities take place in multiple locations across the city, involving a diversity of participants—all focused on making learning more connected. This is a network of people and opportunities.
