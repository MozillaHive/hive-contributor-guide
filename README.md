# Hive Learning Network NYC

Hive NYC is a **network for learning** and a **network that learns**:
* ***Contributors work together to make and learn, using an open source approach that generates opportunities to innovate and discover.***

The first of Mozilla's growing community of city-wide networks, Hive NYC collaborators are aiming to revolutionize learning in New York City and beyond. Hive programs advance **[connected learning](http://clalliance.org/)** and **[web literacy](https://webmaker.org/en-US/resources)**.

## Get Involved

You are invited to join our collective effort to:
* **develop**, **share** and **scale**
* new **ideas**, **tools** and **approaches to learning**
* **connecting young people to opportunity** through productive, social experiences.

Hive NYC creates a distributed learning laboratory where innovations are both developed and spread. Activities take place in multiple locations across the city, involving a diversity of participantsâ€”all focused on making learning more connected. ***This is a network of people and opportunities.***
