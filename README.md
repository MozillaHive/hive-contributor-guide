# Hive Learning Network NYC

Hive NYC is a peer-to-peer learning network. We:
* **develop**, **share** and **scale**
* new **ideas**, **tools** and **approaches to learning**,
* **unlocking opportunity for young people**
* through **problem-solving**, **creativity** and **digital skills**.

The first of Mozilla's growing community of city-wide networks, aiming to revolutionize learning in New York City and beyond. Hive NYC programs advance **[connected learning](http://clalliance.org/)** and **[web literacy](https://webmaker.org/en-US/resources)**.

## Hive NYC Programs

Check out the [portfolio](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio) for an overview of existing Hive NYC projects—here are a few examples to give you a flavor of what we do:

> ***[Explainers as Designers](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/explainers-as-designers/)***
<br/>![Explainers as Designers](http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/8711284515_3bd19877e5_z-1-300x300.jpg)<br/>Iridescent Learning and NY Hall of Science collaborated on a program in which young people helped to enhance the educational visitor experience. Teams designed, coded, produced and pitched a mobile app to increase visitor engagement.

> ***[KickFlip](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/kickflip/)***<br/>![KickFlip](http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/CityLore-KickFlip-300x240.jpg)<br/>Funded by Hive Digital Media Learning Fund and the New York Community Trust, City Lore invited teen skateboarders to share their perspectives by making films. Participants learned filmmaking skills, analyzing their interests and social roles, later learning to design and code games exploring the experience of skateboarding.

> ***[Y-MVP](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/y-mvp/)***<br/>![Y-MVP](http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/Y-MVP-125-300x300.jpg)<br/>YMCA of Greater New York, the Institute of Play and Global Kids teamed up with youth to bring digital badging to health and fitness. Teens used custom hardware and software to plan workouts and earn points, unlocking achievements and awards.

## Get Involved

Hive NYC acts as a distributed learning laboratory where innovations are both developed and spread. Activities take place in multiple locations across the city and involve a diversity of participants. We invest in educators' ability to create digitally rich programs for youth, embedding innovations across organizations.

At Hive NYC, community members learn together, network with each other, consult, advise, discuss best practices and pedagogies, try out new technologies, engage in funded partnerships, design charettes and events, participate in affinity groups and cooperate to solve problems. Most importantly, **we collaborate to design and implement transformative learning opportunities for and with NYC youth**.

You are invited to join our community—strengthen our locally-delivered, globally-connected network so that all young people can gain the skills to fully participate on the web, in work, education, and civic life.
