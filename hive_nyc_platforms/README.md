# Hive NYC Platforms

Hive NYC provides community members with opportunities to form connections, build skills and develop real solutions to challenges. Together, we design new initiatives that encompass the interests and pressing problems that concern our members and leaders, resulting in greater collective impact for the work issues that we care about.
Hive services provide the following benefits to member programs:

### Connections
Hive NYC facilitates opportunities for community members to meet, network and share discoveries. Our infrastructure supports multiple channels of communication through which you can keep in touch with your fellow contributors. We also connect via various regular activities—you are welcome to join any of these and are encouraged to interface with the network using whatever combination of the available methods suits you.

### Skill Development
Hive NYC supports the professional development of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own skills, expertise and resources with others in the network.

### Events
Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas. This process regularly feeds into the iterative design and implementation of the solutions we generate together. These events also play a role in the spread and scale of tools and practices developed within the network.

### Action & Design
Hive NYC encourages collaboration between community members and their affiliations to identify challenges and ultimately design and build solutions. Working together to create models that can replicated and remixed helps Hive learning networks collectively impact NYC and beyond. Action and design activities focus on cooperative hands-on making projects.

## Regular Platforms for Interaction

### Monthly Community Calls
|*connections*|*action & design*|

Monthly conference calls are held on the first Tuesday of each month and provide an opportunity for the Hive NYC community to connect around current issues and problems of practice. Featuring guest speakers and presenters with different monthly topics, participants use a synchronous, [shared document](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hivecall) to collaborate and work together, sharing best practices.

### Monthly Meetups
|*connections*|*skills development*|*events*|

Hive NYC holds meetups on the third Thursday of each month. These are hosted by organizations within the Hive, giving members the chance to get to know the hosting organizations better. Each meetup has a pre-determined topic, usually including case studies, presentations on projects or hands-on playtesting sessions.

#### Host/ Present at a Meet-up or Community Call
We love hearing about the work you are doing. Presenting your current projects and case studies gives you the opportunity to talk about the work you’re doing with the rest of the Hive NYC community.

### Hive Charrettes and Events
|*skills development*|*events*|*action & design*|

Hive NYC offers workshops and design Charrettes through the Hive Research Lab. These events are structured to encourage skill and knowledge development as well as group brainstorming and solutionizing. Visit our [calendar](http://bit.ly/HiveNYCevents) to see upcoming events.

#### Host an Event
Host a meetup or skillshare event at your organization. This is a great way for others in the Hive NYC network to learn more about your organization and the work you’re doing. If you’re interested in hosting an event, please complete the [get involved form](http://bit.ly/hivenyc_getinvolved).

### Webmaker Program
|*skills development*|*events*|*action & design*|

[Webmaker](http://webmaker.org) is Mozilla’s global community dedicated to teaching digital skills and web literacy. We explore together to build a web that's open and made by everyone. See [training](https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/) and [resources](https://webmaker.org/en-US%3F/resources).

#### Community Calls
Webmaker is all about teaching and learning the web. These calls are for the global community of teachers, informal educators, Mozillians, and everyday people making that happen. Share what you're working on, get advice, and compare notes with other mentors around the world. These [calls happen weekly](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Mentor/Community_Calls) on Thursdays at 10am EST.

#### Webmaker Mentor Badge
Once you feel comfortable using and teaching webmaker tools, you can apply for the [Webmaker Mentor badge](https://webmaker.org/badges/webmaker-mentor). This badge is issued by Mozilla to Webmaker community members who teach others. Mentors are proficient in web literacy, contribute to the Webmaker community, and create and remix openly-licensed resources for others to use.

### Office Hours

### Affinity Groups
|*connections*|*skills development*|*action & design*|

Interest-driven affinity groups are formed by Hive NYC community members to identify challenges, brainstorm ideas and develop strategies for community-negotiated solutions. Active affinity groups include: Youth Trajectories Affinity Group (YTAG) and Hive Youth Meetups (HYM). See [Developing a "Pathway Experience" for Hive Youth](https://lynncasper.makes.org/thimble/MTY5Mzc3NzkyMA==/developing-a-pathway-experience-for-hive-youth) and [Hive NYC Affiniity Groups](http://www.slideshare.net/hivelearningnyc/hive-nyc-affinity-groups).

### Cohort Learning Lab
|*connections*|*skills development*|*action & design*|

As part of its laboratory approach to working and learning together, Hive offers creative consultation and project support for all of its funded projects. This approach is formalized through the Cohort Hangouts which provide grantees supported by [Hive Digital Media Learning Fund in The New York Community Trust](http://www.nycommunitytrust.org/AboutTheTrust/CollaborativeFunds/HiveDigitalMediaLearningFund/tabid/620/Default.aspx) a forum to present projects, and related practices, tools, ideas. Cohorts are joined by their collaborators and other community members to think through and discuss the sticky problems of practice that arise during project implementation and are [publicly archived](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hivecohort) for others to learn from.
