# Pathways to Participation

***As a Hive NYC community member, you are encouraged to explore any and all avenues you feel will allow you to participate as fully as possible.***

Over two hundred educators, designers, makers, artists, technologists, librarians and teachers across the five boroughs participate to help New York youth thrive.

The collaborative ethos of the network makes **social ties** and **trusted relationships** between participants particularly important.

The following three general tiers of engagement with Hive NYC have been identified:
* **Explore**
 * *Use your involvement to meet, make and learn with others.*
* **Participate**
 * *Exchange expertise, get involved at events or meetings.*
* **Lead**
 * *Innovate and scale web literacy and connected learning in NYC and beyond.*

These are not prescriptive, fixed roles—they describe the [patterns of behavior observed in existing participants](http://hivenyc.org/2013/08/31/exploring-how-organizations-interface-with-hive-nyc/). Hive NYC is a self-organizing community and [each member connects differently](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_VM3QApL9XfSm12dnJZN1dFRWM/view). The trajectory of contribution within Hive NYC can be [non-linear](http://hivenyc.org/2014/01/28/seven-months-hivenyc-new-member-share/).

Hive educators teach, make and learn within the context of a larger, cross-disciplinary community of practice. The invitation to explore, participate, and eventually lead, recognizes the myriad ways that individuals like you can contribute to—and benefit from—the network.

> The practices of collaborative working and connected learning often present **learning challenges** to new members. Working open can also be an intimidating prospect, but is of immeasurable value to the community—we strive to maintain a supportive environment.
