# Hive Learning in Focus—the Pop-Up

What do we mean when we say that Hive NYC is a “network that learns” and a “network for learning”? Let’s illustrate by looking at an example of Hive NYC methods in action: the Pop-up.

At a Pop-up, Hive NYC’s community of educators and mentors set up hands-on activities in one space at one time. Participants are free to explore each activity casually, with (often multi-generational) individuals playing around, making, talking and interacting.

Pop-ups simultaneously create informal testing laboratories and spread awareness of Hive projects and practices—for educators, mentors and youth. At one activity station a participant  might make a game, at another they might remix a video and so on. By collaborating to create these events, each of Hive’s adult and youth contributors acts as both an educator and a learner.

The pop-up model reflects the catalytic nature of Hive NYC—by engaging diverse multidisciplinary perspectives, linking the personal with shared interests of the community and focusing on generating productive activities in the same space (physical and/or virtual), the network cultivates an ecosystem in which learning and innovation advance at an accelerated rate.

***We do our learning as a community, by building things together.***
