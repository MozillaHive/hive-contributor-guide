<p>What do we mean when we say that Hive NYC is a &quot;network for learning&quot; and a &quot;network that learns&quot;?</p>
<p>Hive NYC creates opportunities for community members to form connections, build skills, and spread and scale their ideas so that others may try/remix them.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-do-it">How Do We Do It?</h2>
<p>Hive NYC HQ provides a range of live forums for the exchange of ideas across different platforms - all in support of our <strong><a href="../what_does_hive_nyc_do/core_values_and_principles.html">Core Values and Principles</a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h3>
<p>Hive NYC facilitates opportunities for community members to meet, network and share discoveries. Our infrastructure supports multiple <strong>channels of communication</strong> through which you can keep in touch with your fellow contributors. We also connect via various <strong>regular activities</strong>—you are welcome to join any of these and are encouraged to interface with the network using whatever combination of the available methods suits you.</p>
<p>Hive NYC supports the <strong>professional development</strong> of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own skills, expertise and resources with others in the network.</p>

<p>Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas. This process regularly feeds into the <strong>iterative design and implementation</strong> of the solutions we generate together. These events also play a role in the <strong><em>spread and scale</em></strong> of tools and practices developed within the network.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="cohort-learning-lab">Cohort Learning Lab</h4>
<p>As part of its laboratory approach to working and learning together, Hive offers creative consultation and project support for all of its funded projects. This approach is formalized through the Cohort Hangouts which provide grantees supported by <a href="http://www.nycommunitytrust.org/AboutTheTrust/CollaborativeFunds/HiveDigitalMediaLearningFund/tabid/620/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Hive Digital Media Learning Fund in The New York Community Trust</a> a forum to present projects, and related practices, tools, ideas. Cohorts are joined by their collaborators and other community members to think through and discuss the sticky problems of practice that arise during project implementation and are <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hivecohort" target="_blank">publicly archived</a> for others to learn from.</p>
<h4 id="member-directory">Member Directory</h4>
<p>This searchable directory contains information on the organizations and individuals within the Hive NYC learning network, including contact information and areas of expertise. <a href="http://directory.hivenyc.org" target="_blank">Sign up</a> and add your organization.</p>
<h4 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h4>
<p>The Hive NYC <a href="http://hivenyc.org/portfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> provides an overview of a range of projects funded through Hive NYC and Hive Digital Media Learning Fund in The New York Community Trust. Grantees of Hive Digital Media Learning Fund make up some of Hive&#39;s most active and committed contributors. Their projects, selected from a competitive grantmaking process, provide a platform for Hive practitioners to explore the innovative solutions and imaginative approaches to learning that lie at the heart of Hive&#39;s desire to create impact and envision change in New York City and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="findingsexemplars">Findings/Exemplars</h3>
<p>Hive NYC contributors are together engaged on a continual process of learning and discovery. Past projects inform the methods we use to best serve our shared aims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/playable-fashion/" target="_blank">Playable Fashion</a></em></strong><br/><img src="http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/12091260715_2cbb8304cd_k-300x300.jpg" alt="Playable Fashion"><br/>Eyebeam and various Hive partners collaborated to explore the intersections between fashion, technology and gaming, with youth creating custom wearable controllers informed by their own narratives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="collaborative-partnerships">Collaborative Partnerships</h4>
<p><a href="../hive_nyc_projects/README.html">Hive NYC Projects</a> demonstrate the power of collaboration to generate innovative connected learning solutions. Past successes relate to multiple disciplines and a variety of stakeholders reflecting Hive NYC&#39;s diversity.</p>
<h4 id="pop-ups">Pop-Ups</h4>
<p>Pop-Ups illustrate Hive methods in action. At a Pop-up, Hive NYC&#39;s community of educators and mentors set up hands-on activities in one space at one time. Participants are free to explore each activity casually, with (often multi-generational) individuals playing around, making, talking and interacting.</p>
<p>Pop-ups simultaneously create informal testing laboratories and spread awareness of Hive projects and practices—for educators, mentors and youth. At one activity station a participant  might make a game, at another they might remix a video and so on. By collaborating to create these events, <em>each adult or youth contributor acts as both an educator and a learner</em>.</p>
<p>The Pop-up model reflects the catalytic nature of Hive NYC—by engaging diverse multidisciplinary perspectives, linking the personal with shared interests of the community and focusing on generating productive activities in the same space (physical and/or virtual), the network cultivates an ecosystem in which learning and innovation advance at an accelerated rate.</p>
<h4 id="affinity-groups">Affinity Groups</h4>
<p>Interest-driven affinity groups are formed by Hive NYC community members to identify challenges, brainstorm ideas and develop strategies for community-negotiated solutions. Active affinity groups include: Youth Trajectories Affinity Group (YTAG) and Hive Youth Meet-ups (HYM). See <a href="https://lynncasper.makes.org/thimble/MTY5Mzc3NzkyMA==/developing-a-pathway-experience-for-hive-youth" target="_blank">Developing a &quot;Pathway Experience&quot; for Hive Youth</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hivelearningnyc/hive-nyc-affinity-groups" target="_blank">Hive NYC Affinity Groups</a>.</p>
