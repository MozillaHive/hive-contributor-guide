# How Does Hive NYC Work?

Hive NYC is a **network for learning** and a **network that learns**:
* Creating new pathways for youth to learn valued skills.
* Sharing resources and best practices, advancing professional development.

Hive NYC HQ provides an infrastructure of support:
* [Exchanges](#exchanges) - _communication and skill sharing_
* [Experiments](#experiments) - _collaborative problem solving_
* [Exemplars](#exemplars) - _learning from findings_

By operating within the Mozilla Learning community, members are able to expand projects to broaden and/or deepen their impact:
* [How We Spread and Scale](#how_we_spread_and_scale)

### Exchanges

Hive NYC facilitates a range of **live forums** for community members to meet, network and share discoveries. We also connect via various **regular activities**â€”you are welcome to join any of these.

Hive NYC supports the **professional development** of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own expertise and resources.

Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas, using an **iterative design and implementation** approach. These events contribute to the ***spread and scale*** of tools and practices developed in the network.

### Experiments

Hive NYC encourages collaboration between community members to identify challenges and design/build solutions. Working together to create models that can replicated and remixed amplifies Hive Learning Networks' collective impact.

### Exemplars

Hive NYC contributors are together engaged on a continual process of learning and discovery. Past projects inform the methods we use to advance our shared aims.

## How We Spread and Scale

Hive NYC supports spread and scale of member programs to expand in terms of new contexts/partnerships, to develop content, and to reach more youth.

By connecting to the [wider Mozilla community](../why_mozilla/README.md), Hive NYC provides channels to showcase findings and engage in global exchange. In addition, members have access to relevant trainings, such as the [series of workshops run by PASE (Partnership for After School Education)](http://hivenyc.org/2015/03/18/pase-spread-and-scale-recap/) for members planning for spread and scale.
