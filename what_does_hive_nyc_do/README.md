# What Does Hive NYC Do?

What do we mean when we say that Hive NYC is a "network for learning" and a "network that learns"?

Hive NYC creates opportunities for community members to form connections, build skills, and spread and scale their ideas so that others may try/remix them.

## How Do We Do It?

Hive NYC HQ provides a range of live forums for the exchange of ideas across different platforms - all in support of our **[Core Values and Principles](../what_does_hive_nyc_do/core_values_and_principles.html)**.

### Exchanges

Hive NYC facilitates opportunities for community members to meet, network and share discoveries. Our infrastructure supports multiple **channels of communication** through which you can keep in touch with your fellow contributors. We also connect via various **regular activities**—you are welcome to join any of these and are encouraged to interface with the network using whatever combination of the available methods suits you.

Hive NYC supports the **professional development** of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own skills, expertise and resources with others in the network.

Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas. This process regularly feeds into the **iterative design and implementation** of the solutions we generate together. These events also play a role in the ***spread and scale*** of tools and practices developed within the network.

#### Minigroup

Hive NYC Minigroup is for people interested in connected learning, sharing tools, expertise and educational resources. Some of these individuals represent Hive NYC member organizations and some do not. Those that are not associated with a Hive member organization join us from an array of communities including public schools, maker spaces, tech companies, conferences, government offices and more. In all cases, Hive NYC Minigroup members have the option to use this forum as a place to post opportunities, questions and resources relevant to the community. If you’d like to be added to our minigroup community please contact [info@hivenyc.org](mailto:info@hivenyc.org).

#### Office Hours

Hive NYC opens its doors to meet with any community members looking to get more involved each Wednesday at 2pm. Please contact [lynn@hivenyc.org](mailto:lynn@hivenyc.org) to schedule an appointment for you or your organization.

#### Monthly Community Calls

Monthly conference calls are held on the first Tuesday of each month and provide an opportunity for the Hive NYC community to connect around current issues and problems of practice. Featuring guest speakers and presenters with different monthly topics, participants use a synchronous, [shared document](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hivecall) to collaborate and work together, sharing best practices.

##### Host / Present at a Meet-up or Community Call
We love hearing about the work you are doing. Presenting your current projects and case studies gives you the opportunity to talk about the work you’re doing with the rest of the Hive NYC community.

#### Monthly Meet-ups

Hive NYC holds meet-ups on the third Thursday of each month. These are hosted by organizations within the Hive, giving members the chance to get to know the hosting organizations better. Each meet-up has a pre-determined topic, usually including case studies, presentations on projects or hands-on playtesting sessions.

#### Hive Charrettes and Events

Hive NYC offers workshops and design Charrettes through the Hive Research Lab. These events are structured to encourage skill and knowledge development as well as group brainstorming and solutionizing. Visit our [calendar](http://bit.ly/HiveNYCevents) to see upcoming events.

### Experiments

Hive NYC encourages collaboration between community members and their affiliations to identify challenges and ultimately design and build solutions. Working together to create models that can replicated and remixed helps Hive learning networks collectively impact NYC and beyond.

> ***[Smartphone Photography Project](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/smart-phone-photography-project/)***<br/>![Smartphone Photography Project](http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/NYCSalt_img03.jpg)<br/>NYC SALT developed a curriculum to explore the use of social media in digital photography, adopting online interaction styles to create a participatory experience.

#### Cohort Learning Lab

As part of its laboratory approach to working and learning together, Hive offers creative consultation and project support for all of its funded projects. This approach is formalized through the Cohort Hangouts which provide grantees supported by [Hive Digital Media Learning Fund in The New York Community Trust](http://www.nycommunitytrust.org/AboutTheTrust/CollaborativeFunds/HiveDigitalMediaLearningFund/tabid/620/Default.aspx) a forum to present projects, and related practices, tools, ideas. Cohorts are joined by their collaborators and other community members to think through and discuss the sticky problems of practice that arise during project implementation and are [publicly archived](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hivecohort) for others to learn from.

#### Member Directory

This searchable directory contains information on the organizations and individuals within the Hive NYC learning network, including contact information and areas of expertise. [Sign up](http://directory.hivenyc.org) and add your organization.

#### Portfolio

The Hive NYC [Portfolio](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio) provides an overview of a range of projects funded through Hive NYC and Hive Digital Media Learning Fund in The New York Community Trust. Grantees of Hive Digital Media Learning Fund make up some of Hive's most active and committed contributors. Their projects, selected from a competitive grantmaking process, provide a platform for Hive practitioners to explore the innovative solutions and imaginative approaches to learning that lie at the heart of Hive's desire to create impact and envision change in New York City and beyond.

### Findings/Exemplars

Hive NYC contributors are together engaged on a continual process of learning and discovery. Past projects inform the methods we use to best serve our shared aims.

> ***[Playable Fashion](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/playable-fashion/)***<br/>![Playable Fashion](http://hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/12091260715_2cbb8304cd_k-300x300.jpg)<br/>Eyebeam and various Hive partners collaborated to explore the intersections between fashion, technology and gaming, with youth creating custom wearable controllers informed by their own narratives.

#### Collaborative Partnerships

[Hive NYC Projects](../hive_nyc_projects/README.md) demonstrate the power of collaboration to generate innovative connected learning solutions. Past successes relate to multiple disciplines and a variety of stakeholders reflecting Hive NYC's diversity.

#### Pop-Ups

Pop-Ups illustrate Hive methods in action. At a Pop-up, Hive NYC's community of educators and mentors set up hands-on activities in one space at one time. Participants are free to explore each activity casually, with (often multi-generational) individuals playing around, making, talking and interacting.

Pop-ups simultaneously create informal testing laboratories and spread awareness of Hive projects and practices—for educators, mentors and youth. At one activity station a participant  might make a game, at another they might remix a video and so on. By collaborating to create these events, *each adult or youth contributor acts as both an educator and a learner*.

The Pop-up model reflects the catalytic nature of Hive NYC—by engaging diverse multidisciplinary perspectives, linking the personal with shared interests of the community and focusing on generating productive activities in the same space (physical and/or virtual), the network cultivates an ecosystem in which learning and innovation advance at an accelerated rate.

#### Affinity Groups

Interest-driven affinity groups are formed by Hive NYC community members to identify challenges, brainstorm ideas and develop strategies for community-negotiated solutions. Active affinity groups include: Youth Trajectories Affinity Group (YTAG) and Hive Youth Meet-ups (HYM). See [Developing a "Pathway Experience" for Hive Youth](https://lynncasper.makes.org/thimble/MTY5Mzc3NzkyMA==/developing-a-pathway-experience-for-hive-youth) and [Hive NYC Affinity Groups](http://www.slideshare.net/hivelearningnyc/hive-nyc-affinity-groups).

#### Webmaker Mentor Badge
Once you feel comfortable using and teaching webmaker tools, you can apply for the [Webmaker Mentor badge](https://webmaker.org/badges/webmaker-mentor). This badge is issued by Mozilla to Webmaker community members who teach others. Mentors are proficient in web literacy, contribute to the Webmaker community, and create and remix openly-licensed resources for others to use.

## How We Spread and Scale

Hive NYC connects members to the wider Mozilla community, providing channels to showcase findings and engage in global exchange. In addition, members have access to relevant trainings, such as the [series of workshops run by PASE (Partnership for After School Education)](http://hivenyc.org/2015/03/18/pase-spread-and-scale-recap/) for members planning to expand their programs.

### Webmaker Program

[Webmaker](http://webmaker.org) is Mozilla’s global community dedicated to teaching digital skills and web literacy. We explore together to build a web that's open and made by everyone. See [training](https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/) and [resources](https://webmaker.org/en-US%3F/resources).

#### Webmaker Community Calls
Webmaker is all about teaching and learning the web. These calls are for the global community of teachers, informal educators, Mozillians, and everyday people making that happen. Share what you're working on, get advice, and compare notes with other mentors around the world. These [calls happen weekly](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Mentor/Community_Calls) on Thursdays at 10am EST.
