# How Does Hive NYC Work?

Community members drive the network through active participation. Hive NYC HQ provides an infrastructure of support for this work:
* [Regular channels for exchange](#exchanges)
* [Platforms for experimenting](#experiments)
* [Learning from exemplars](#exemplars)

You are invited to [get involved](#get-involved).

### Exchanges

Hive NYC facilitates a range of **live forums** for community members to network, as well as regular activities and events such as design charettes. We support the **professional development** of community members through workshops and trainings—participants are encouraged to share their own expertise and resources.

### Experiments

Hive NYC members use openly-networked collaboration that includes co-designing programs—creating models that can be replicated and remixed to maximize on our collective impact. Professional practice typically involves peer observation, resource sharing and process documentation.
