### Exchanges

Hive NYC facilitates a range of **live forums** for community members to meet, network and share discoveries. We also connect via various **regular activities**—you are welcome to join any of these.

Hive NYC supports the **professional development** of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own expertise and resources.

Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas, using an **iterative design and implementation** approach. These events contribute to the ***spread and scale*** of tools and practices developed in the network.

### Experiments

Hive NYC encourages collaboration between community members to identify challenges, design and build solutions. Working together to create models that can replicated and remixed amplifies Hive Learning Networks' collective impact.

### Exemplars

Hive NYC contributors are together engaged on a continual process of learning and discovery. Past projects inform the methods we use to advance our shared aims.

## How We Spread and Scale

Hive NYC supports spread and scale of member programs to expand in terms of new contexts/partnerships, to develop content, and to reach more youth.

By connecting to the wider Mozilla community, Hive NYC provides channels to showcase findings and engage in global exchange. In addition, members have access to relevant trainings, such as the [series of workshops run by PASE (Partnership for After School Education)](http://hivenyc.org/2015/03/18/pase-spread-and-scale-recap/) for members planning for spread and scale.

### Webmaker Program

[Webmaker](http://webmaker.org) is Mozilla’s global community dedicated to unlocking opportunity for all citizens of the Web. Hive NYC operates within the context of this worldwide network of educators and activists teaching/learning digital skills and web literacy through making.
