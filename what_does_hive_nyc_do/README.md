# How Does Hive NYC Work?

Hive NYC is a **network for learning** and a **network that learns**.

## Every participant within Hive NYC is an educator and a learner

See our [community page](http://hivenyc.org/community) for current members.

Hive NYC HQ provides an infrastructure of support for the work the community does:
* [Exchanges](#exchanges)
* [Experiments](#experiments)
* [Exemplars](#exemplars)

### Exchanges

Hive NYC facilitates a range of **live forums** for community members to meet and network. We also connect via various **regular activities** such as design charettes—you are welcome to join any of these.

Hive NYC supports the **professional development** of our community members through workshops and trainings. Participants are encouraged to share their own expertise and resources.

Hive NYC provides opportunities for community members to demo and play-test their programs and ideas, using an **iterative design and implementation** approach. These events contribute to the [spread and scale](spread_and_scale.html) of tools and practices developed in the network.

### Experiments

Hive NYC members use openly-networked collaboration that includes peer observation, resource sharing and process documentation. Working together to create models that can replicated and remixed amplifies Hive Learning Networks' collective impact.

See the [portfolio](http://hivenyc.org/portfolio/) for an overview.
