# Hive NYC Core Values and Principles

Hive NYC is a dynamic, fluid movement in which the community members together determine the future direction the network takes. However, it can be helpful to formalize the shared objectives we are all working to serve, bearing in mind that you are free to participate in a manner of your choosing.

In their development and practice, Hive members advance the adoption of digital skills and web literacy through connected learning. Our programs are:
* **Innovative**
 * We originate and explore creative new approaches to learning.
* **Meaningful**
 * We collaborate on a common vision to unlock real-world opportunities.
* **Participatory**
 * We build solutions together on engaging challenges stimulated by learner (and community) interest.
* **Open**
 * Our inclusive distributed network provides equitable access to ordinarily under-served communities.

**Hive NYC contributors**:
* Create and try out new tools and practices.
* Connect young people to relevant academic, work or civic opportunity.
* Engage with youth by incorporating self-direction into learning experiences, giving a sense of agency.
* Design opportunities to learn valued skills and competencies that can be recognized, for example using Open Badges.
* Support and encourage collaboration between members (and youth).
* Build, test and spread solutions via iterative, constructive learning activities.
* Learn in a social context by fostering contribution, cooperation and interaction.
* Share resources, opportunities and learning gains.
* Leverage technology and digital media to equip youth to fully participate on the web.
* Work open, preserving interoperability and distributed access to resources.
* Learn together—as a network.

Hive welcomes participation in whatever way suits your unique situation, so don't feel overwhelmed by this list of activities—this is what we expect of ourselves as a community, and your contribution will be valued, whatever form it takes.

You are encouraged to find inspiration for your own programs from within the network. By exploring these approaches and tools, you will also find opportunities to grow your own community involvement.
