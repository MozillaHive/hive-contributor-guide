As part of its mission to promote openness and innovation, Mozilla shepherds Hive Learning Networks within a global community dedicated to unlocking opportunity for all citizens of the web. Hive NYC acts as a local delivery mechanism for this ambitious movement, building educators' ability to create digitally rich programs for youth.

Hive NYC is locally connected and globally networked, making and testing tools and practices in collaboration with stakeholders throughout the city and around the world. As the flagship program in the Hive Learning Networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities.
