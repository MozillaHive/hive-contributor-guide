# Why Mozilla

As part of its mission to promote openness and innovation, Mozilla shepherds Hive Learning Networks within a global community dedicated to unlocking opportunity for all citizens of the web. Hive NYC acts as a local delivery mechanism for this ambitious movement, making and testing tools and practices in collaboration with stakeholders throughout the city.

Mozilla Learning Networks value the web as a global public resource—representing and stimulating a culture of openness that can produce benefits throughout society, from education to economy.

Hive programs use open networks to facilitate connected learning practices—from the Internet connecting global communities, to collaborative relationships connecting individuals and organizations locally. This work generates adaptable, iteratively tested resources, such as curricula for learning the vital web literacy skills young people need to fully participate in online life—and networked learning experiences that allow them to explore the education, work and civic pathways available to them in offline life.

Hive Learning Networks put youth in a position to use their online participation to participate in and shape their local communities. By empowering young people to make the web, this activity also informs future citizens who will be motivated to keep the web open.

As the flagship program in the Hive Learning Networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities of practice.
