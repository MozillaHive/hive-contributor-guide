# Why Mozilla

As part of its mission to promote openness and innovation, Mozilla shepherds Hive Learning Networks within a global community dedicated to unlocking opportunity for all citizens of the web. Hive NYC acts as a local delivery mechanism for this ambitious movement, making and testing tools and practices in collaboration with stakeholders throughout the city.

Mozilla Learning Networks value the web as a global public resource—representing and stimulating an open culture that can produce benefits throughout society, from education to economy.

Hive programs use open networks to facilitate connected learning practices:
* individuals and organizations connected locally via collaborative relationships
* sharing learning outcomes and resources within a global community connected via the Internet

This work generates adaptable, iteratively tested resources, such as curricula for learning the vital web literacy skills young people need to fully participate in online life—and networked learning experiences that allow them to explore the education, work and civic pathways available to them in offline life.

Hive Learning Networks put youth in a position to use their online participation to shape their local communities. By learning to become digital makers in this context, young people gain an intuitive understanding of the importance of keeping the web open.

As the flagship program in the Hive Learning Networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities of practice around the world.
