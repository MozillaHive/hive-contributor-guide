As part of its mission to promote openness and innovation, Mozilla shepherds Hive Learning Networks within a global community dedicated to unlocking opportunity for all citizens of the web. Hive NYC acts as a local delivery mechanism for this ambitious movement, making and testing tools and practices in collaboration with stakeholders throughout the city.

Hive programs use open networks to facilitate connected learning practices:
* individuals and organizations connected locally via collaborative relationships
* sharing learning outcomes and resources within a global community connected via the Internet

As the flagship program in the Hive Learning Networks ecosystem, Hive NYC is a model for others hoping to build similar communities of practice around the world.
