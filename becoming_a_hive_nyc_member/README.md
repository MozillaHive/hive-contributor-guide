# Hive NYC Community

Hive NYC is diverse—this variety feeds the innovation we generate and discover. There isn't a typical member—each stakeholder brings their own skills and perspective.

However, Hive NYC contributors are committed to:
* Finding opportunities to collaborate with others.
* Sharing resources throughout the community.
* Connecting young people to opportunity.
* Discovering new kinds of learning approaches and practices.
* Making opportunities available to under-served communities.
* Enriching the learning experience with hands-on making and social interaction.
* Using technology and digital media skills to empower young people to be active participants on the web.
* Building solutions to challenges—as a community.

As a contributing Hive NYC organization or individual community member, you will *actively seek multiple opportunities to experiment and co-produce with other members* (especially those with whom you would not naturally connect). In doing so your projects will sustain the Hive ecosystem as an incubator for invention.

Hive projects demonstrate a commitment to *action and design*. Contributors make real solutions to problems, addressing challenges that stretch beyond the needs and capabilities of their individual organizations.

Hive members thrive by *sharing knowledge, learning outcomes and opportunities* with one another. We use a variety of engagement routes and communication channels so that you are able to choose those methods that fit best within your own programs. See the [Platforms](../hive_nyc_platforms/README.md) overview for more.

## Hive Community Member Badge

For an overview of what’s involved in being an active Hive participant, check out the [Hive Community Member badge](https://webmaker.org/en-US/badges/hive-community-member).

As the criteria indicate, the badge recognizes members who design their programs to prioritize the aims of connected learning and to transform the academic, economic and social landscape for young people in the 21st century, who collaborate with other members, and who share or scale resources/innovations, connecting through Hive channels.
