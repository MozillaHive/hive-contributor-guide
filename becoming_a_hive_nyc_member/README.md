# Hive NYC Community

Hive NYC is diverse—this variety feeds the innovation we generate and discover. There isn't a typical member—each stakeholder brings their own skills and perspective to serve the following commitments:
* Finding opportunities to collaborate with others.
* Sharing resources throughout the community.
* Connecting young people to opportunity.
* Discovering new kinds of learning approaches and practices.
* Making opportunities available to under-served communities.
* Enriching the learning experience with hands-on making and social interaction.
* Using technology and digital media skills to empower young people to be active participants on the web.
* Building solutions to challenges—as a community.

As a contributing Hive NYC organization or individual community member, you will *actively seek multiple opportunities to experiment and co-produce with other members* (especially those with whom you would not naturally connect). In doing so your projects will sustain the Hive ecosystem as an incubator for invention.

Hive projects demonstrate a commitment to *action and design*. Contributors make real solutions to problems, addressing challenges that stretch beyond the needs and capabilities of their individual organizations.

Hive members thrive by *sharing knowledge, learning outcomes and opportunities* with one another. We use a variety of engagement routes and communication channels so that you are able to choose those methods that fit best within your own programs.
