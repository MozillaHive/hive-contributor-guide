# Hive NYC Community

## Every participant within Hive NYC is an educator and a learner

From code clubs to science museums, a diverse range of organizations from across New York City participate in Hive—this variety feeds the innovation we generate and discover. See our [community page](http://hivenyc.org/community) for current members.

There isn't a typical member—each stakeholder brings their own skills and perspective.

As a contributing Hive NYC organization or individual, you will **actively seek multiple opportunities to experiment and co-produce with other members** (especially those with whom you would not naturally connect). In doing so your projects will sustain the Hive ecosystem as an *incubator for invention*.

Hive projects demonstrate a commitment to *action and design*. Contributors make real solutions to problems, addressing challenges that stretch beyond the needs and capabilities of their individual organizations.

Hive members thrive by *sharing knowledge, learning outcomes and opportunities* with one another. We use a variety of engagement routes and communication channels so that you are able to choose those methods that fit best within your own context.
