# Becoming a Member

Hive NYC is diverse—this variety feeds the innovation we generate and discover. For this reason there isn’t a typical Hive member—each stakeholder brings a different perspective and skill-set.

A number of key characteristics of Hive community members reflect our collective aims—ask yourself if these align with your own personal or organizational objectives:
* Proactive interest in collaborating with others
* Belief in sharing resources throughout the community
* Commitment to connecting young people to opportunity
* Openness to discovering new kinds of learning approaches and practices
* Determination to make opportunities available to under-served communities
* Conviction that hands-on making and social interaction can enrich the learning experience
* Understanding that technology and digital media skills empower young people to be active participants on the web
* Appreciation for the power of communities to build solutions to challenges together

We welcome you to join us—let’s transform the learning landscape for educators, mentors and youth. Together we can create an impact that will reach both across and far beyond New York city.

## Working and Learning Together

As a contributing Hive organization or individual community member, you will actively seek and explore collaborative interactions and partnerships within the network. By finding multiple opportunities to experiment and co-produce with other members (especially those with whom you would not naturally connect), your projects will sustain the Hive ecosystem as an incubator for invention.

## Building Solutions to Problems

Hive projects demonstrate a commitment to action and design. Contributors make real solutions to problems through collaboration, enabling them to address challenges that stretch beyond the needs and capabilities of their individual organizations.

## Sharing Learning Experiences and Resources
Hive members thrive by sharing knowledge, learning outcomes and opportunities with one another. We use a variety of engagement routes and communication channels so that contributors are able to choose those methods that fit best within their own programs. See the [Platforms](../hive_nyc_platforms/README.md) overview for more.

## Hive Community Member Badge

For an overview of what’s involved in being an active Hive participant, check out the [Hive Community Member badge](https://webmaker.org/en-US/badges/hive-community-member).

As the criteria indicate, the badge recognizes members who design their programs to prioritize the aims of connected learning and to transform the academic, economic and social landscape for young people in the 21st century, who collaborate with other members and who share or scale resources or innovations, connecting through Hive channels.
