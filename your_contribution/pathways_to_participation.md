# Pathways to Participation

All community members within Hive NYC engage with connected learning practices. Examples of this include attending or observing member programs, co-designing, remixing or reviewing programs, sharing equipment or other resources, making yourself available to assist other members, creating tools or teaching kits, capturing program design through online channels or representing Hive NYC at conferences, in the press or in academic contexts. Lead members engage with these processes at a deeper and more integral level than most community members.

As a Hive NYC community member, you are encouraged to explore any and all avenues you feel will allow you to participate as fully as possible. If you want to make a strategic effort to develop you or your organization’s involvement in Hive NYC, the infrastructure and support is available to help you to do that. A key aim within the network is to create and identify opportunities for you to increase your participation—and to celebrate your invaluable contributions, however they emerge.

As a learning network, Hive educators teach, make and learn within the context of a larger, cross-disciplinary community of practice. The invitation to explore, participate (and eventually lead) within the network recognizes the myriad ways that individuals like you can contribute to, and benefit from, Hive NYC.
