# Your Hive NYC Contribution

Like any beehive—***in which productivity is dependent upon cooperation amongst individual bees***—the success of Hive NYC programs is driven by the interactions between community members. Over two hundred educators, designers, makers, artists, technologists, librarians and teachers across the five boroughs participate with the community to help New York youth thrive.

Hive NYC community members engage with the principles of connected learning in both program design and professional practice. Contributors use openly-networked collaboration that includes peer observation, resource sharing and process documentation.

## What Will Your Contribution Look Like?

How you go about helping to serve [Hive NYC's goals](../why_a_learning_network/hive_vision_and_goals.html) is up to you.

The collaborative ethos of the network makes **social ties** between participants particularly important. The resulting interactions often involve advising, supporting, brokering relationships, exchanging expertise, co-designing solutions and sharing opportunities.

Contributors often find new colleagues and co-conspirators outside of their organizations through Hive NYC. This puts members in a position to encourage one another to explore and test new ideas. Hive NYC HQ provides an ***innovation infrastructure*** in support of these activities, framing participation across the network.

*Whatever role you anticipate having, it is important to point out that the practices of collaborative working and connected learning often present **learning challenges** to new members. Similarly, working open can be an intimidating prospect, but is of immeasurable value to the community—we strive to maintain a supportive environment, so getting on-board need not be an overwhelming experience.*

### Every participant within Hive NYC is an educator and a learner.

This model of interaction allows youth to curate their own learning experiences. It also creates opportunities for contributors to experience and discover new roles—including leadership.

The following three general tiers of engagement have been identified:
* **Explore**
 * *Use your Hive NYC involvement to meet, make and learn with others.*
* **Participate**
 * *Exchange expertise, get involved at events or meetings.*
* **Lead**
 * *Innovate and scale web literacy and connected learning in NYC and beyond.*

These are not prescriptive, fixed roles—they describe the [patterns of behavior observed in existing participants](http://hivenyc.org/2013/08/31/exploring-how-organizations-interface-with-hive-nyc/). Hive NYC is a self-organizing community and each member connects differently.

Like the programs the community develops, leadership within Hive NYC is something that participants co-create together.

As many members will testify, the trajectory of contribution within Hive NYC can be [non-linear](http://hivenyc.org/2014/01/28/seven-months-hivenyc-new-member-share/). The path you take will be [unique to you and your organization](http://hivenyc.org/2014/01/28/seven-months-hivenyc-new-member-share/).

* Active community members naturally move between levels of participation in various ways, often by taking small steps or making what may seem like relatively trivial decisions.
 * *For example, a member asks via the Hive NYC Minigroup if anyone has a suitable space for a project, rather than e.g. arranging the space through their own organizational channels.*

By increasingly placing work within the networked context of Hive NYC, members benefit from a deeper level of involvement. By developing your contribution, you help to increase the reach of Hive NYC programs and amplify the network’s collective impact for change.

Consider a hypothetical example of a Hive NYC engagement pathway:
> Community member Mary starts getting involved with Hive NYC by joining the mailing list. Mary also begins to attend meet-ups, calls and events, through which she hears about activities she thinks her organization could benefit from (and contribute to) by taking part—she reaches out and participates. Mary provides feedback on another member’s project or offers advice on an aspect she happens to have expertise in. Through these exchanges, Mary starts a partnership with another member or contributes resources to their project.

> Inspired by the various developments she hears about within Hive NYC, Mary continues to incorporate technology, production and social cooperation into her programs, reporting back with results and engaging in discussions. Mary also introduces another Hive NYC member to a colleague/ other member, or someone else in the learning community, with reference to a practice under development. Having observed and participated in a range of innovative projects, Mary suggests a project she thinks may be a new idea.

Ultimately this is a pathway that may lead to a role influencing the future direction and strategy of Hive NYC programs, acquiring funding and playing an integral role in supporting other members.

## Pathways to Participation

As a Hive NYC community member, you are encouraged to explore any and all avenues you feel will allow you to participate as fully as possible.

If you want to make a strategic effort to develop you or your organization's involvement in Hive NYC, the support is available to help you to do that. A key aim within the network is to create and identify opportunities for you to increase your participation—and to celebrate your invaluable contributions, however they emerge.

As a learning network, Hive educators teach, make and learn within the context of a larger, cross-disciplinary community of practice. The invitation to explore, participate (and eventually lead) within the network recognizes the myriad ways that individuals like you can contribute to, and benefit from, Hive NYC.
