# Hive DML Fund Eligibility

Hive NYC's lead member organizations are non-profit, youth-facing organizations working together to create learning experiences that connect young people to opportunity. Lead organizations within Hive NYC have access to the DML Fund.

The Fund's grants support innovative connected learning projects that explore digital media technologies to change the way youth learn and spread the results to a wide audience. The Hive DML Fund's grants are awarded through a competitive process.

Selected projects demonstrate the following characteristics:
* Learners specialize and gain mastery by pursuing their interests.
* Participants create artifacts that demonstrate a common interest or purpose.
* Everyone shares authority and contributes expertise.
* Resources are distributed.
* Youth have equitable access to programs and resources.
* Learning environments link home, school, personal interests and community.

To be eligible to receive funding from NYCT, your organization must:
* be vouched by Hive NYC HQ

Funds are typically released twice a year at the discretion of NYCT and travel grants are available once a year.
