# What is Leadership in the Context of Hive NYC?

What is leadership? In Hive NYC, [it takes many forms](http://hivenyc.org/2014/11/24/leadership-hive-nyc/).

In general, lead members:
* Drive the direction of the network to best advance the aspirations of web literacy and connected learning.
* Excel at the practices of developing innovations to serve these goals.
* Actively spread and scale projects to maximize on the network's impact.

Mozilla and Hive NYC HQ support these efforts by maintaining the community infrastructure, providing access to funding, technical tools and expertise.

As a peer network and professional learning community, Hive NYC relies on its lead members to use their interests and concerns to help make Hive's [ambitious goals](../why_a_learning_network/hive_vision_and_goals.html) a reality. In this context, leadership is **distributed** and **vital**.

## Leadership Behavior and Practices

Here are some examples of leadership observed in Hive NYC:
* Giving constructive feedback on a project or idea
* Connecting an organization/individual to the network
* Sharing resources (*for example assets such as a space for another member to develop a project in*)
* Facilitating a meeting, call or workshop
* Advising another member in an area of expertise
* Hiring someone from within the network / connecting a network contact to work
* Providing professional development
* Making assets known and available to other members
* Highlighting a funding opportunity
* Piloting a new idea across organizations
* Evangelizing about a unique aspect of another member’s project (*in an openly networked channel*)
* Recruiting or brokering youth to get involved in a project
* Documenting a project/practice openly
* Disseminating evaluation outcomes, practices and resources (*for example assessments and surveys*)
* Being ambitious and taking risks when planning projects
* Openly sharing information about youth wants, needs or interests
* Brokering a partnership or exchange between community members
* Refining a tool or practice so that others can use it
* Advocating/ pressing for change within and outside of Hive NYC
* Attributing Hive NYC and its role

Acting as a leader within Hive is often about knowing ***how others can leverage you*** to benefit their own connected learning and web literacy projects. Hive NYC leaders design strategies and **take control of the conversation**.

## How Does Leadership Arise?

In this network, leaders **grow** and new roles are discovered through collaborative working practices. *Highlighting these behaviors means that more community members are exposed to them.* In this way the Hive NYC ecosystem ***catalyzes*** not only new learning practices but also other ***networked behaviors***—including:
* leadership approaches that are connected, distributed and effective in serving the network's goals.

Nurturing this model of leadership requires a community in which **trust** and **generosity** are valued at a premium.

Leadership within Hive can arise within both formal and informal collaborations. As a lead contributor, you will:
* deliver the objectives of connected learning and web literacy
* **support other members** in implementing, testing and spreading them
* take an active role in long-term planning
 * at the project level *and* with an overview of the work the community does.

Lead contributors are needed to identify challenges at the network level within Hive NYC—and to get involved in problem-solving on these issues.
