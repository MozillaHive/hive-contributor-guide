# Become a Hive NYC Leader

Members who are eligible to become lead contributors will already be immersed in the Hive NYC community. If you feel you or your organization could make a leading contribution to Hive NYC, you are welcome to put yourself forward for consideration.

In order to become a lead organization within Hive NYC, you will need to gather some information to support your adoption of the role. This supporting information should include:
* A brief description of your contribution within Hive NYC to date
 * including specific examples of activities, events and other engagement channels you have been involved with
* An overview of how your contribution aligns with Hive NYC's [five year goal](http://www.clawrence.org/2014/07/10/hive-learning-networks-vision-goals-and-conditions-for-impact/) to mobilize, create, catalyze and grow web literacy and digital skills through connected learning.

Bear in mind that, within Hive NYC, leaders are grown and discovered. To be eligible for a recognized leadership role, it is expected that you will already exhibit some of the behaviors that are seen as characterizing leadership within the network. Examples of this would be supporting other members, contributing resources or brokering partnerships.

Once you have your supporting information prepared, you are invited to submit it for consideration [LINK]. If all goes well you'll be on your way to playing a vital role in driving the network towards its goal of educational transformation, making connected learning and web literacy central to the learning experiences of educators and youth in New York and beyond.

If you would like to become a lead organization in future but don't feel youâ€™re at the right stage yet, please refer to the information throughout this guide for ways to develop your role or contribute to and benefit from Hive's vibrant learning community.
