# Become a Hive NYC Leader

Members who are eligible to become lead contributors will already be immersed in the Hive NYC community. If you feel you or your organization could make a leading contribution to Hive NYC, you are welcome to put yourself forward for consideration.

Some information will be required to support your adoption of the lead role, including:
* A brief description of your contribution within Hive NYC to date
 * with specific examples of activities, events and other engagement channels you have been involved with.
* An overview of how your contribution aligns with Hive NYC's [five year goal](http://www.clawrence.org/2014/07/10/hive-learning-networks-vision-goals-and-conditions-for-impact/) to mobilize, create, catalyze and grow web literacy / digital skills through connected learning.

Hive NYC leaders are grown and discovered. If you are eligible for a recognized lead role, it is likely that you already exhibit leadership behaviors. *Examples would be supporting other members, contributing resources or brokering partnerships.*

**Once you have your supporting information prepared, you are invited to submit it for consideration [LINK].**

*If you would like to become a lead organization in future but don't feel youâ€™re at that stage yet, refer to the information throughout this guide for ways to develop your role, including the [Leadership Toolkit](../leadership_in_hive_nyc/leadership_toolkit.html).*
