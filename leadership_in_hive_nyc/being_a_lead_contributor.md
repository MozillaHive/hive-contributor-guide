# Being a Lead Contributor

Organizations designated as lead members:
* Develop and scale new ideas through [Hive Digital Media and Learning Fundâ€™s competitive funding mechanisms](http://hivenyc.org/about-hive-nyc/hive-fund/).
 * Spread Hive innovations as well as Mozilla's practices/values through high-level partnerships and collective impact interventions.

Through these efforts, lead contributors model Hive NYC's core principles and practices across the city and within the field. Lead contributors are determined by Hive NYC leadership, then financially vetted by The New York Community Trust to serve as lead grantees (while any organization can be a partner) on forthcoming grants.

Through access to the Hive DML Fund, lead contributors can play a strategic role in the planning and proposal generation for substantial projects. *Hive NYC does not itself provide funding, but HQ and lead contributors work in collaboration with community members to broker quality partnerships that secure funding for projects within the connected learning ethos.*
