# Being a Lead Contributor

Organizations designated as lead members help drive Hive NYC's efforts to champion digital skills and web literacy through connected learning. They develop and scale new ideas through [Hive Digital Media and Learning Fundâ€™s competitive funding mechanisms](http://hivenyc.org/about-hive-nyc/hive-fund/), spread Hive innovations as well as Mozilla's practices and values through high-level partnerships plus collective impact interventions that take place across the city. Through these efforts, lead contributers model Hive NYC's core principles and practices across the city and within the field. Lead contributors are determined by Hive NYC leadership and then financially vetted by The New York Community Trust to serve as lead grantees (while any organization can be a partner) on forthcoming grants.

Through access to the Hive DML funding, lead contributors can play a strategic role in the planning and proposal generation for substantial projects. Hive NYC does not itself provide funding, but HQ and lead contributors work in collaboration with community members to broker quality partnerships that secure funding for projects that fit within the connected learning ethos.
