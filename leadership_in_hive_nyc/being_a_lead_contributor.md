# Lead Organizations

Lead contributors model Hive NYC's core principles and practices across the city and within the field. Through access to the [Hive DML Fund](http://hivenyc.org/about-hive-nyc/hive-fund/), lead contributors play a strategic role in the planning and proposal generation for substantial projects.

*Hive NYC does not itself provide funding, but HQ and lead contributors work in collaboration with community members to broker quality partnerships that secure funding for projects within the connected learning ethos.*

## Benefits of Being a Lead Contributor

Lead organizations have **access to funding to develop, pilot and scale ambitious connected learning and web literacy projects** with Hive NYC's vetted stakeholders and partners, including NYC DOE Office of Post Secondary Readiness and the Hive Digital Media Learning Fund.

Additionally, through travel grants, Hive NYC’s online portfolio gallery, Mozilla's communication networks and the ability to participate in an extensive program of events, ***your ideas, concerns and discoveries will be shared and championed on the global stage***.

Whether you're a small start-up or a storied institution, being a Hive NYC lead contributor gives you the opportunity to influence the future direction of learning in NYC—and enjoy a clear view of the network's progress towards this goal of educational transformation.

Hive NYC enjoys a unique set of powerful assets, as a learning network *fueled by Mozilla's mission to promote openness, opportunity and engagement on the web*. Lead contributors are able to use these assets to build the kind of trust that:
* cultivates long-term relationships
* enables youth to flourish
* generates a growing body of work that demonstrates the value of connected learning.

A more subtle but crucial benefit to being a lead member of Hive NYC is *the advantage enjoyed by anyone who chooses to fully immerse themselves within a community*. Lead organizations are the backbone of the community, ensuring that programs undertaken uphold the values each member is committed to. As a lead member, you will enjoy multiple rewarding connections to others in both supporting and supported roles.

The programs you pilot as a Hive NYC leader will be subject to **extensive exposure** in the context of Mozilla's global network. Lead projects exemplify and showcase the work Hive NYC does, representing excellence in learning innovation and acting as inspiration for educators around the world.
