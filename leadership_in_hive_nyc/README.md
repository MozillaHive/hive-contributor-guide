# Leadership in Hive NYC

While Hive NYC HQ oversees the infrastructure that keeps the network functioning, **lead member organizations ensure Hive NYC's ambitious goals have authenticity and meaning on the ground**.

Lead contributors are entrusted to develop and scale innovative project ideas, representing Hive Learning Networks on the local, national and global stage.

## What is Leadership?

In Hive NYC, leadership [takes many forms](http://hivenyc.org/2014/11/24/leadership-hive-nyc/). In general, lead members:
* ***Drive the network to advance the aspirations of web literacy and connected learning.***
* ***Excel at the practices in developing innovations to serve these goals.***
* ***Actively spread and scale projects to maximize on the network's impact.***

Hive NYC leadership is **distributed**.

### Leadership Behavior and Practices:
* Giving constructive feedback
* Connecting someone to the network
* Sharing resources
* Facilitating a meeting
* Advising a member in an area of expertise
* Hiring someone from within the network / connecting a network contact to work
* Providing professional development
* Highlighting a funding opportunity
* Piloting a new idea across organizations
* Evangelizing about a unique aspect of another member's project
* Recruiting youth for someone else's project
* Documenting a project/practice openly
* Disseminating evaluation outcomes
* Being ambitious and taking risks
* Openly sharing information about youth needs/interests
* Brokering a partnership between members
* Refining a tool so that others can use it
* Advocating for change within and outside of Hive NYC
* Attributing Hive NYC and its role

These are examples of the types of activity lead members engage in, but there is no fixed way to act as a leader—it's often about knowing ***how others can leverage you*** to benefit their own projects. Hive NYC leaders design strategies and **take control of the conversation**.

### How Does Leadership Happen?

The Hive NYC ecosystem ***catalyzes*** not only new learning practices but also other ***networked behaviors***—including:
* leadership approaches that are connected, distributed and effective in serving the community's goals.

Nurturing this model of leadership requires a context in which **trust** and **generosity** are valued at a premium. Here, leadership can arise within both formal and informal collaborations.

Lead contributors are needed to identify challenges at the network level within Hive NYC—and to help address these issues.
