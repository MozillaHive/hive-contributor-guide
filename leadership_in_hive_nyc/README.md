# Leadership in Hive NYC

While Hive NYC HQ oversees the infrastructure that keeps the network functioning, **lead member organizations ensure Hive NYC's ambitious goals have authenticity and meaning on the ground**.

Lead contributors are entrusted to develop and scale innovative project ideas, representing Hive Learning Networks on the local, national and global stage.

Lead Hive NYC members involved have included Iridescent Learning, partnering with YMCA, The POINT CDC, Reel Works and the Girl Scouts.

## What is Leadership?

In Hive NYC, leadership [takes many forms](http://hivenyc.org/2014/11/24/leadership-hive-nyc/). In general, lead members:
* ***Drive the network to advance the aspirations of web literacy and connected learning.***
* ***Excel at the practices in developing innovations to serve these goals.***
* ***Actively spread and scale projects to maximize on the network's impact.***

Hive NYC leadership is **distributed**.

### Leadership Behavior and Practices:
* Giving constructive feedback
* Connecting someone to the network
* Sharing resources
* Facilitating a meeting
* Advising a member in an area of expertise
* Hiring someone from within the network / connecting a network contact to work
* Providing professional development
* Highlighting a funding opportunity
* Piloting a new idea across organizations
* Evangelizing about a unique aspect of another member's project
* Recruiting youth for someone else's project
* Documenting a project/practice openly
* Disseminating evaluation outcomes
* Being ambitious and taking risks
* Openly sharing information about youth needs/interests
* Brokering a partnership between members
* Refining a tool so that others can use it
* Advocating for change within and outside of Hive NYC
* Attributing Hive NYC and its role

These are examples of the types of activity lead members engage in, but there is no fixed way to act as a leader—it's often about knowing ***how others can leverage you*** to benefit their own projects. Hive NYC leaders design strategies and **take control of the conversation**.

### How Does Leadership Happen?

The Hive NYC ecosystem ***catalyzes*** not only new learning practices but also other ***networked behaviors***—including:
* leadership approaches that are connected, distributed and effective in serving the community's goals.

Nurturing this model of leadership requires a context in which **trust** and **generosity** are valued at a premium. Here, leadership can arise within both formal and informal collaborations.

Lead contributors are needed to identify challenges at the network level within Hive NYC—and to help address these issues.
