# Leadership in Hive NYC

Hive NYC is a dynamic learning network fueled by the shared goals and interests of its community members. While Hive NYC HQ oversees the infrastructure of supports that keep the network functioning, **lead member organizations ensure Hive NYC's [ambitious goals](../why_a_learning_network/hive_vision_and_goals.html) have authenticity and meaning on the ground**.

Hive NYC's vital lead member organizations are entrusted to develop and scale innovative project ideas, representing Hive Learning Networks on the local, national and global stage.

This program generates productive collaboration between youth identifying as artists (MOUSE teens) and techies (Parsons Scholars), with peers sharing skills and knowledge across technology and design. By undertaking evaluation and reflection on the project, [documenting](http://www.gadgiteration.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Final_8-8.pdf) its outcomes, Parsons Design and Technology (D+T) team make their learning gains accessible to other Hive members.

Acting as a leader is often about knowing ***how others can leverage you*** to benefit their own connected learning and web literacy projects. Hive NYC leaders design strategies and **take control of the conversation**.

### How Does Leadership Happen?

Hive NYC leaders **grow** and new roles are discovered through collaborative working practices. *Highlighting these behaviors means that more community members are exposed to them.*

The Hive NYC ecosystem ***catalyzes*** not only new learning practices but also other ***networked behaviors***—including:
* leadership approaches that are connected, distributed and effective in serving the network's goals.

Nurturing this model of leadership requires a community in which **trust** and **generosity** are valued at a premium.

Leadership can arise within both formal and informal collaborations. As a lead contributor, you will:
* ***deliver*** the objectives of connected learning and web literacy
* ***support other members*** in implementing, testing and spreading them
* take an active role in ***long-term planning***
 * at the project level *and* with an overview of the work the community does.

Lead contributors are needed to identify challenges at the network level within Hive NYC—and to get involved in problem-solving on these issues.
