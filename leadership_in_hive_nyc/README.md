# Leadership in Hive NYC

Hive NYC is a dynamic learning network fueled by the shared goals and interests of its community members. While Hive NYC HQ oversees the infrastructure of supports that keep the network functioning, it is the time, energy and contribution of its valued lead member organizations that insure that Hive NYC’s ambitious goals have authenticity and meaning on the ground.

While aligned individuals and organizations are welcome to explore and participate in the open-source laboratory approach, it is the vetted and proven cadre of organizations that make up of Hive NYC's cohort of lead member organizations that are entrusted and tasked with the responsibility to develop and scale innovative project ideas and represent Hive Learning Networks on a local, national and global stage.

This section specifically examines how leadership roles, benefits and responsibilities functions within Hive NYC Learning Network—and provides guidance on how to develop and chart you and your organization's role within this dynamic, distributed professional learning ecosystem.
